# UI Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of **medium to small-sized UI-focused projects** built using:

- âœ… **HTML5**
- âœ… **CSS3**
- âœ… **Vanilla JavaScript**
- ðŸš« No JavaScript frameworks or libraries are used
- ðŸŽ¨ One project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling; all others use plain CSS

## Purpose

These projects are built as part of my personal learning journey in front-end web development. They are primarily focused on practicing and demonstrating **UI/UX implementation**, **DOM manipulation**, and **responsive design** â€” not full-stack functionality.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- Reusable UI components
- Animations and transitions
- Small interactive widgets (like modals, sliders, dropdowns)
- Clean and semantic HTML structure
- Organized, scalable CSS and JavaScript

## Notes

This repository is purely front-end. Itâ€™s meant for showcasing **user interface logic and design**, not backend or full applications.
